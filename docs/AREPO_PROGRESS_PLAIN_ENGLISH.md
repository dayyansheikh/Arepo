# AREPO — Plain-English Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-10-19 22:24 UTC+1
**Phase:** Phase 4 (edge discovery) in progress. Autonomous programme started 15 Oct.
**Programme state:** RUNNING. Server queue plus **Claude autopilot (approved by you, installed 15 Oct ~20:05 UTC+1)**.
**Next Claude session:** automatic. The autopilot checks every 30 min and starts a session (up to 5h) whenever none is
running. After a usage limit it waits for the reset time, then continues. **Server queue:** checks every 2 minutes.

## 1. Right now
- **Autopilot:** session running since 21:29 UTC+1 (19 Oct).
- **Server:** both lanes busy: batch 11 attention data (network; about 80 min per round) and short checks between its
  rounds. Queued: batch 12 earthquake data, batch 12 options check (Tuesday at the US market open), batch 13/14/15 checks.
- **Recorded today as "not testable" (7 tests counted, no result either way):**
  - Batch 13 maker losses (2): too few usable fills in the 4-day window (163 and 427 vs 500 per class).
  - Batch 15 election night (2): the fixed market search found only 26 of 511 races; an independent check confirmed
    this is how the frozen design behaves, not a code fault.
  - Batch 16 price grain (1): only 7 markets had fills at both price grains.
  - Batch 13's record job was changed so it computes no outcome numbers when its tests cannot run.
- **Independent reviews done:** batches 12, 13, 15 and 16 code accepted after fixes; batch 16's server check passed.
- **Batch 17 (from round 8):** designed and challenged; the design was revised (one review round). Its first counting
  jobs are being coded for the server's compute lane; the test window starts 26 Oct.
- **Second free server:** still "out of host capacity" at Oracle; it retries every 10 min.

## 2. Approvals needed from you
1. ~~Automatic Claude sessions~~ **APPROVED and installed 15 Oct** (full power, your call).
   - Pause: `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` (on the Mac, in the repo). Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to
     end the running session.
   - It only runs while the Mac is awake. If you chat with me while it's working, pause it first, so two sessions don't
     edit at once.
2. ~~One-time usage reset~~ **HANDLED by you (17 Oct)**; no more reminders needed.
3. ~~Server disk~~ **APPROVED 15 Oct** (deletion of server copies that are verified in a backup). The nightly job
   is in a one-night trial run (it only lists what it would delete) before real deletion. The weekly backup of the
   live evidence logs is set up too. Handled by the ops session.
4. ~~Kalshi overnight gap~~ **DECIDED 15 Oct: fill it** (recorded in the ledger before any results, with a sensitivity check).
   Reset reminders also scheduled on your phone: Sun 18 Oct 19:00 and Tue 20 Oct 10:00 UTC+1.

5. **Archive rotation by ~20 Oct (needed by batch 3).** The nightly deletion of backed-up server copies must move from
   trial to real by about 20 Oct. If not, batch 3's live stages wait, and missed data stays missing. Handled by the ops
   session; flagging the dependency only.

6. ~~Server disk~~ **DONE 17 Oct** (you enlarged it to 100 GB, free).

## 3. Usage plan (your schedule; reset times are your statement, not verified)
| When | Plan |
|---|---|
| Now to Sun 18 Oct | Phase A: build, experiment, review |
| After the one-time reset, before Wed 21 Oct | Phase B: strongest experiments, wider screening |
| Thu 22 Oct onward (normal weekly reset) | Phase C: continue |

## 4. Findings so far (all development or exploratory; no tradable edge)
- **Order flow (E007):** real but tiny (about 0.36c).
- **Reversal (E004):** real, but not tradable; likely quote noise.
- **95 economic setups:** none profitable after costs.
- **Hypothesis battery:** 18 of 72 survived; 16 replicate on fresh markets. None covers costs.
- **Wallet freshness:** null in 3 analyses.
- **Surprise detector:** beats chance, but is volatility-driven; live test (E011) is analysed after 11 Nov.
- **Stale cross-venue horizons (batch 12):** no finding; a shuffled-horizon check reproduced the pattern.
- **Kalshi lead:** the strongest historical predictor; live test (E009/E010) is analysed after 3 Nov.

| Leading candidates | Awaiting confirmation | Confirmed edge |
|---|---|---|
| Kalshi lead; order flow; book/liquidity interactions (being tested) | E009/E010 (3 Nov), E011 (11 Nov) | **None** |

## 5. Infrastructure
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Server disk | 100 GB disk, 56 GB free (measured 19 Oct 21:39 UTC+1); collection cap 45 GB, 4 GB free-disk stop unchanged. |
| Server size | 1 CPU, about 5.6 GB RAM. A second free server (1 CPU, 6 GB, 100 GB) is being requested automatically every 10 min until Oracle has capacity. |
| Mac | No background jobs. |

## 6. Manual pause and stop
- **Claude autopilot (Mac):** `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `status`.
- **Pause research jobs:** `ssh oracle '~/arepo/.venv/bin/python ~/arepo/scripts/oracle/queue_worker.py pause'`. Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to also halt the running job.
- **Status:** the same command with `status`.
