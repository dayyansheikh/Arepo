# AREPO — Plain-English Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-10-22 07:43 UTC+1
**Phase:** Phase 4 (edge discovery) in progress. Autonomous programme started 15 Oct.
**Programme state:** RUNNING. Server queue plus **Claude autopilot (approved by you, installed 15 Oct ~20:05 UTC+1)**.
**Next Claude session:** automatic. The autopilot checks every 30 min and starts a session (up to 5h) whenever none is
running. After a usage limit it waits for the reset time, then continues. **Server queue:** checks every 2 minutes.

## 1. Right now
- **New live test registered: E022** (from LT4). It asks whether displayed liquidity that cannot actually be traded
  against says anything about later moves. It passed its size check this morning and collects from 26 Oct to 16 Nov;
  single analysis after 17 Nov. That makes **seven registered live tests** (E009/E010, E011, E012-E014, E015, E022, E026).
- **Server resize: DONE** (2 CPUs, 12 GB, free). Down 6 minutes overnight; the short gaps are logged as they happened.
- **LT5 (round 11 ideas):** three of its five planned tests failed their counting checks this morning and were dropped
  before any test, uncounted (one needed a bigger effect than allowed, two had too few cases). Two remain to be counted.
- **LT6 (round 11 ideas): closed with no test.** All four planned tests failed their counting checks this morning (too few
  cases, or a measure that could not be separated from a related one); dropped before any test, uncounted.
- **Honest pattern:** most planned tests die at the counting stage, before any data on the outcome is read. That is the
  checks working as designed; round 13 was written with these failures in mind.
- **LT7 (five planned tests from round 12):** the counting code passed its checks; its data list is sealed (after a small
  fix: the seal wrongly reported some present files as missing). A quick check of reward fields runs next.
- **New ideas round 13: done** (10 ideas). Its best three are being written up as planned live tests LT8 (a quiet order
  book that shifts behind an unmoved price; how much of a recent move the order book had already absorbed; each market's own
  busy hours). They would collect from about January, after LT7.
- **Model run (MC1)** is queued after the LT6 jobs; it only fits on the larger server.
- **Copy-skilled wallets (E026):** registered; collection starts 25 Oct (phone note then).
- **Live tests waiting for their single analysis:** E009/E010 (3 Nov), E011 (11 Nov), E012-E014 (13 Nov), E015
  (15 Nov), E022 (17 Nov), E026 (6 Dec).
## 2. Approvals needed from you
1. ~~Automatic Claude sessions~~ **APPROVED and installed 15 Oct** (full power, your call).
   - Pause: `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` (on the Mac, in the repo). Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to
     end the running session.
   - It only runs while the Mac is awake. If you chat with me while it's working, pause it first, so two sessions don't
     edit at once.
2. ~~One-time usage reset~~ **HANDLED by you (17 Oct)**; no more reminders needed.
3. ~~Server disk~~ **APPROVED 15 Oct** (deletion of server copies that are verified in a backup). The nightly job
   is in a one-night trial run (it only lists what it would delete) before real deletion. The weekly backup of the
   live evidence logs is set up too. Handled by the ops session.
4. ~~Kalshi overnight gap~~ **DECIDED 15 Oct: fill it** (recorded in the ledger before any results, with a sensitivity check).
   Reset reminders also scheduled on your phone: Sun 18 Oct 19:00 and Tue 20 Oct 10:00 UTC+1.

5. **Archive rotation by ~20 Oct (needed by batch 3).** The nightly deletion of backed-up server copies must move from
   trial to real by about 20 Oct. If not, batch 3's live stages wait, and missed data stays missing. Handled by the ops
   session; flagging the dependency only.

6. ~~Server disk~~ **DONE 17 Oct** (you enlarged it to 100 GB, free).

7. ~~More server memory for MC1~~ **APPROVED 21 Oct:** resize to 2 CPU / 12 GB (still free), scheduled automatically
   for 22 Oct about 03:40 UTC+1. MC1 is re-queued afterwards.

8. **NEW (21 Oct, not urgent): let Claude clear finished restore copies on the server.** Restore copies are
   hash-checked copies of data that is safe in the archive, made so a job can re-read old files. About 9 GB of them
   are finished with or soon will be (measured 22 Oct: batch 18 4.9 GB finished now; LT4 3.0 GB and LT3 0.3 GB after
   LT6's flow count today; LT5 0.8 GB after its count today; LT6 1.2 GB after its counts). Jobs stop at a
   40 GB data limit (**33 GB on 22 Oct**, and LT7's restore will add more), so they will need clearing within days. The safety hook rightly stops
   Claude from deleting anything in the data folder. **Decision needed:** approve a short clearing session for these
   copies only (each one listed and checked against the archive first). Batch 17 no longer needs this: it now writes
   to a fresh folder instead.

## 3. Usage plan (your schedule; reset times are your statement, not verified)
| When | Plan |
|---|---|
| Now to Sun 18 Oct | Phase A: build, experiment, review |
| After the one-time reset, before Wed 21 Oct | Phase B: strongest experiments, wider screening |
| Thu 22 Oct onward (normal weekly reset) | Phase C: continue |

## 4. Findings so far (all development or exploratory; no tradable edge)
- **Order flow (E007):** real but tiny (about 0.36c).
- **Reversal (E004):** real, but not tradable; likely quote noise.
- **95 economic setups:** none profitable after costs.
- **Hypothesis battery:** 18 of 72 survived; 16 replicate on fresh markets. None covers costs.
- **Wallet freshness:** null in 3 analyses.
- **Surprise detector:** beats chance, but is volatility-driven; live test (E011) is analysed after 11 Nov.
- **Stale cross-venue horizons (batch 12):** no finding; a shuffled-horizon check reproduced the pattern.
- **Kalshi lead:** the strongest historical predictor; live test (E009/E010) is analysed after 3 Nov.

| Leading candidates | Awaiting confirmation | Confirmed edge |
|---|---|---|
| Kalshi lead; order flow; book/liquidity interactions (being tested) | E009/E010 (3 Nov), E011 (11 Nov), E012-E014 (13 Nov), E015 (15 Nov), E022 (17 Nov), E026 (6 Dec) | **None** |

## 5. Infrastructure
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Server disk | 100 GB disk, 38 GB free (measured 22 Oct 06:20 UTC+1); collection cap 45 GB, 4 GB free-disk stop unchanged. |
| Server size | **2 CPUs, 12 GB RAM since 22 Oct** (free tier). A second free server (1 CPU, 6 GB, 100 GB) is being requested automatically every 10 min until Oracle has capacity. |
| Mac | No background jobs. |

## 6. Manual pause and stop
- **Claude autopilot (Mac):** `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `status`.
- **Pause research jobs:** `ssh oracle '~/arepo/.venv/bin/python ~/arepo/scripts/oracle/queue_worker.py pause'`. Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to also halt the running job.
- **Status:** the same command with `status`.
