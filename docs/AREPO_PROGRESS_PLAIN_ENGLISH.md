# AREPO — Plain-English Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-10-19 10:09 UTC+1
**Phase:** Phase 4 (edge discovery) in progress. Autonomous programme started 15 Oct.
**Programme state:** RUNNING. Server queue plus **Claude autopilot (approved by you, installed 15 Oct ~20:05 UTC+1)**.
**Next Claude session:** automatic. The autopilot checks every 30 min and starts a session (up to 5h) whenever none is
running. After a usage limit it waits for the reset time, then continues. **Server queue:** checks every 2 minutes.

## 1. Right now
- **Autopilot:** a new session started at about 10:03 UTC+1 (19 Oct), after the usage limit reset. The previous
  session stopped at about 05:55 with four pieces of work unfinished; all four have been restarted.
- **Server:** it ran out of ready work at about 09:00. Now running: **batch 12's "mentions" data chain** (ID check,
  then about 7-9 hours of price downloads), started 10:08.
- **Batch 11 results so far:**
  - The ID check finished (98.7% of markets matched; the limit is 98%).
  - **Part W (Wikipedia):** it stopped at the first step. The saved censoring windows cover only about 58% of
    finished markets, and the pre-registered rule needs 99%. An engineering check is under way: is this a real gap in
    the data, or a counting fault? It is only recorded as a counted "not testable" result if no fault is found.
  - **Parts P/A (politics, attention):** prices for 1,857 markets were downloaded. The attention step ran out of
    memory three times. It is being fixed and will re-run under a new job number.
- **Batch 13:** both connection checks **failed**: one join step for the touch markets, and three steps for the
  crypto part. Each failure is being checked: real data limit, or code fault? Faults get fixed and the checks re-run.
- **Batch 14:** the 18 code fixes are being finished. **Batch 15 (election night, freeze by 1 Nov):** its code is
  being written. Two independent helpers are re-compiling which way each state's late count moves, from saved 2022
  and 2024 sources.
- **Batch 12, three untested parts (earthquakes, stock-option prices, large-trade footprints):** the code is being
  written now. The stock-option and earthquake parts collect live data, so they start as soon as they are frozen.
- **Batch 16:** a design is being drafted from the round-7 ideas that can be tested on data already on the server.
- **Second free server:** still "out of host capacity" at Oracle; it retries every 10 min.

## 2. Approvals needed from you
1. ~~Automatic Claude sessions~~ **APPROVED and installed 15 Oct** (full power, your call).
   - Pause: `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` (on the Mac, in the repo). Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to
     end the running session.
   - It only runs while the Mac is awake. If you chat with me while it's working, pause it first, so two sessions don't
     edit at once.
2. ~~One-time usage reset~~ **HANDLED by you (17 Oct)**; no more reminders needed.
3. ~~Server disk~~ **APPROVED 15 Oct** (deletion of server copies that are verified in a backup). The nightly job
   is in a one-night trial run (it only lists what it would delete) before real deletion. The weekly backup of the
   live evidence logs is set up too. Handled by the ops session.
4. ~~Kalshi overnight gap~~ **DECIDED 15 Oct: fill it** (recorded in the ledger before any results, with a sensitivity check).
   Reset reminders also scheduled on your phone: Sun 18 Oct 19:00 and Tue 20 Oct 10:00 UTC+1.

5. **Archive rotation by ~20 Oct (needed by batch 3).** The nightly deletion of backed-up server copies must move from
   trial to real by about 20 Oct. If not, batch 3's live stages wait, and missed data stays missing. Handled by the ops
   session; flagging the dependency only.

6. ~~Server disk~~ **DONE 17 Oct** (you enlarged it to 100 GB, free).

## 3. Usage plan (your schedule; reset times are your statement, not verified)
| When | Plan |
|---|---|
| Now to Sun 18 Oct | Phase A: build, experiment, review |
| After the one-time reset, before Wed 21 Oct | Phase B: strongest experiments, wider screening |
| Thu 22 Oct onward (normal weekly reset) | Phase C: continue |

## 4. Findings so far (all development or exploratory; no tradable edge)
- **Order flow (E007):** real but tiny (about 0.36c).
- **Reversal (E004):** real, but not tradable; likely quote noise.
- **95 economic setups:** none profitable after costs.
- **Hypothesis battery:** 18 of 72 survived; 16 replicate on fresh markets. None covers costs.
- **Wallet freshness:** null in 3 analyses.
- **Surprise detector:** beats chance, but is volatility-driven; live test (E011) is analysed after 11 Nov.
- **Stale cross-venue horizons (batch 12):** no finding; a shuffled-horizon check reproduced the pattern.
- **Kalshi lead:** the strongest historical predictor; live test (E009/E010) is analysed after 3 Nov.

| Leading candidates | Awaiting confirmation | Confirmed edge |
|---|---|---|
| Kalshi lead; order flow; book/liquidity interactions (being tested) | E009/E010 (3 Nov), E011 (11 Nov) | **None** |

## 5. Infrastructure
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Server disk | 100 GB disk, 58 GB free (measured 18 Oct 20:49 UTC+1); collection cap 45 GB, 4 GB free-disk stop unchanged. |
| Server size | 1 CPU, about 5.6 GB RAM. A second free server (1 CPU, 6 GB, 100 GB) is being requested automatically every 10 min until Oracle has capacity. |
| Mac | No background jobs. |

## 6. Manual pause and stop
- **Claude autopilot (Mac):** `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `status`.
- **Pause research jobs:** `ssh oracle '~/arepo/.venv/bin/python ~/arepo/scripts/oracle/queue_worker.py pause'`. Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to also halt the running job.
- **Status:** the same command with `status`.
