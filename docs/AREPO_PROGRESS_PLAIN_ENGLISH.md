# AREPO — Plain-English Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-10-19 02:03 UTC+1
**Phase:** Phase 4 (edge discovery) in progress. Autonomous programme started 15 Oct.
**Programme state:** RUNNING. Server queue plus **Claude autopilot (approved by you, installed 15 Oct ~20:05 UTC+1)**.
**Next Claude session:** automatic. The autopilot checks every 30 min and starts a session (up to 5h) whenever none is
running. After a usage limit it waits for the reset time, then continues. **Server queue:** checks every 2 minutes.

## 1. Right now
- **Autopilot:** session running since about 01:45 UTC+1 (19 Oct).
- **Server:** batch 11's ID check is now set to resume cleanly in 34-minute pieces. Earlier pieces kept hitting
  the 40-minute limit, but none of the work was lost (about 445,000 IDs were already saved). It needs roughly 10 more
  hours; then about 10-15 hours of batch 11 downloads follow automatically. **Batch 12's stale-horizon test ran (one counted test): no finding.** Gaps between
  matching Polymarket and Kalshi markets do close more slowly when resolution is far away (about 140 vs 49 minutes),
  but randomly shuffling the horizons produced the same pattern in 16% of tries (1.5% allowed), and it leans on a few
  events. So it cannot be tied to the horizon. That part of batch 12 is closed.
- **Caught and fixed this session (nothing lost, nothing changed scientifically):**
  - Batch 12's test had been queued before its rules file was written, so it correctly refused to run. The rules
    were checked independently and then frozen.
  - One collector step (batch 3's quote extraction) had been refusing to run since about 17 Oct, because its disk
    limit was missed when the others were raised. Fixed; it catches up on the 19 waiting captures, since their
    source files are still on the server.
  - Two batch 8 jobs that wait for their declared start on 21 Oct would have been marked "failed" by the queue's
    patience limit tonight. The queue now understands a declared start date.
- **In progress:** a check of batch 13's code against its design; batch 14 code; batch 15 design (US election
  night on 3 Nov, an AI-leaderboard idea, and Kalshi-listed-first pairs); and a new round of original ideas
  (round 7, by the Fable model as you asked).
- **Second free server:** still "out of host capacity" at Oracle; it retries every 10 min.

## 2. Approvals needed from you
1. ~~Automatic Claude sessions~~ **APPROVED and installed 15 Oct** (full power, your call).
   - Pause: `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` (on the Mac, in the repo). Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to
     end the running session.
   - It only runs while the Mac is awake. If you chat with me while it's working, pause it first, so two sessions don't
     edit at once.
2. ~~One-time usage reset~~ **HANDLED by you (17 Oct)**; no more reminders needed.
3. ~~Server disk~~ **APPROVED 15 Oct** (deletion of server copies that are verified in a backup). The nightly job
   is in a one-night trial run (it only lists what it would delete) before real deletion. The weekly backup of the
   live evidence logs is set up too. Handled by the ops session.
4. ~~Kalshi overnight gap~~ **DECIDED 15 Oct: fill it** (recorded in the ledger before any results, with a sensitivity check).
   Reset reminders also scheduled on your phone: Sun 18 Oct 19:00 and Tue 20 Oct 10:00 UTC+1.

5. **Archive rotation by ~20 Oct (needed by batch 3).** The nightly deletion of backed-up server copies must move from
   trial to real by about 20 Oct. If not, batch 3's live stages wait, and missed data stays missing. Handled by the ops
   session; flagging the dependency only.

6. ~~Server disk~~ **DONE 17 Oct** (you enlarged it to 100 GB, free).

## 3. Usage plan (your schedule; reset times are your statement, not verified)
| When | Plan |
|---|---|
| Now to Sun 18 Oct | Phase A: build, experiment, review |
| After the one-time reset, before Wed 21 Oct | Phase B: strongest experiments, wider screening |
| Thu 22 Oct onward (normal weekly reset) | Phase C: continue |

## 4. Findings so far (all development or exploratory; no tradable edge)
- **Order flow (E007):** real but tiny (about 0.36c).
- **Reversal (E004):** real, but not tradable; likely quote noise.
- **95 economic setups:** none profitable after costs.
- **Hypothesis battery:** 18 of 72 survived; 16 replicate on fresh markets. None covers costs.
- **Wallet freshness:** null in 3 analyses.
- **Surprise detector:** beats chance, but is volatility-driven; live test (E011) is analysed after 11 Nov.
- **Stale cross-venue horizons (batch 12):** no finding; a shuffled-horizon check reproduced the pattern.
- **Kalshi lead:** the strongest historical predictor; live test (E009/E010) is analysed after 3 Nov.

| Leading candidates | Awaiting confirmation | Confirmed edge |
|---|---|---|
| Kalshi lead; order flow; book/liquidity interactions (being tested) | E009/E010 (3 Nov), E011 (11 Nov) | **None** |

## 5. Infrastructure
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Server disk | 100 GB disk, 58 GB free (measured 18 Oct 20:49 UTC+1); collection cap 45 GB, 4 GB free-disk stop unchanged. |
| Server size | 1 CPU, about 5.6 GB RAM. A second free server (1 CPU, 6 GB, 100 GB) is being requested automatically every 10 min until Oracle has capacity. |
| Mac | No background jobs. |

## 6. Manual pause and stop
- **Claude autopilot (Mac):** `python3 scripts/autopilot/autopilot.py pause` / `resume` / `stop` / `status`.
- **Pause research jobs:** `ssh oracle '~/arepo/.venv/bin/python ~/arepo/scripts/oracle/queue_worker.py pause'`. Use `resume` to undo, or `stop` to also halt the running job.
- **Status:** the same command with `status`.
